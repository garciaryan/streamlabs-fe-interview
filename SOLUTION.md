# Solution

### 1. How long did this solution take?
 This took me about 5 hours to complete, mainly because I spent some extra time looking into edge cases and figuring out Vue's new Pinia library for stores.
### 2. What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
The most difficult part was the state management. Ensuring that I had a specific state for each canvas viewport requirement and making sure that it was managed efficiently.
### 3. What about this assignment did you find unclear?
There wasn't much unclear about it, thankfully. The only thing was whether or not a user should be able to upload any photo or just the two provided photos.
### 4. What challenges did you face that you did not expect?
I was mostly challenged by the initializing of the state once the user decided to share something on the canvas. I spent some time trying to do in the template, but eventually landed on using an action and that worked really well.
### 5. Did you feel like this assignment had an appropriate level of difficulty?
Yes I think so. There were a lot of cases to be mindful of, so it required me to do some planning before I actually implemented anything.
### 6. Briefly explain your decision to use tools, frameworks, and libraries like React, Vue, etc.
I used Vue because that is Streamlabs framework of choice. It made sense to stick to that. I used a couple of libraries like Vue Final Modal (I didn't think building a modal from scratch was a good use of time) and Font Awesome for icons.
### 7. Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.
For the most part, I used the mock pretty religiously. For spacing, some values were strange, but that was declared in the mock. There was no mobile mock, so there isn't much in the way of a mobile view, but I assumed that a tablet view should scale similarly to a desktop view.
